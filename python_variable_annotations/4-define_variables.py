This module demonstrates type annotations for basic Python variables.

It defines several variables with explicit type annotations including
integer, float, boolean, and string types. This module serves as an
example of how to properly annotate variables in Python 3 following
best practices for type hints and documentation. The variables represent
common data types used in Python programming.
